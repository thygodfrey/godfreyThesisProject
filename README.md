This my undergraduate thesis project, a system implementation on testing the time efficiency of using Bilingual Latent Dirichlet Allocation for English and Filipino COVID-19-related tweets, applying a modified version of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm for a shorter runtime, and lasty, implementing sentiment analysis on the clustered data using Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Hope this could help anybody having trouble on text processing!

Thank you.
